New Research Illuminates the Hidden Signals of Physician Fatigue—And Raises Questions About AI in Healthcare A new study led by Associate Professor Chenhao Tan analyzes hundreds of thousands of emergency room notes, uncovering how language patterns reveal physician fatigue and warning of potential pitfalls as AI-generated text enters clinical care. Associate Professor Chenhao Tan When you rush into an emergency room, you may notice the pace, the urgency, and the concentration on every face. What you probably never consider is this: Could the notes your doctor writes about you contain clues about how tired they are—and could that fatigue spill over into decisions about your care? New research from a team featuring Associate Professor Chenhao Tan from the Department of Computer Science and Data Science at the University of Chicago explores this very question, using advanced language models to read between the lines of over 129,000 clinical notes. The study , published in Nature Communications and co-authored by phd student Chao-Chun Hsu, Ziad Obermeyer from UC Berkeley, and Tan, shines a spotlight on the written traces of physician fatigue in emergency departments and issues a warning about relying on AI to write or interpret medical notes. READING FATIGUE BETWEEN THE LINES Medical notes aren’t just administrative paperwork; they help summarize each patient’s story, diagnosis, and treatment plan. But hidden within the words, Tan’s team discovered, are consistent signals of a physician’s fatigue state—particularly after a grueling week of emergency shifts. The researchers trained a computational model to distinguish notes written by doctors who had worked at least five of the last seven days—a classic recipe for fatigue—from those penned by more rested physicians. The model didn’t just pick up on obvious differences. Instead, it zeroed in on subtle, interpretable features: the predictability of each word, the complexity of the writing, and even the emotional tone of certain phrases. “This was a surprise to us,” expressed Tan. “We were surprised how the predicted fatigue is robustly correlated with other independent measures of high fatigue such as overnight shifts and high patient volumes.” FATIGUE IN TEXT, AND ITS IMPACT ON CARE This predictability, the core task of modern large language models, became a useful indicator: Fatigued doctors wrote more formulaic notes and used fewer words expressing insight (like “I believe” or “I think”), less often used first-person pronouns, and sometimes even produced a greater proportion of tense or angry language. These textual signals aligned not just with grueling shift schedules, but also with classic signs of burnout such as working overnight or seeing particularly high patient volumes. But does a tired-sounding note mean a patient gets lower-quality care? The answer, at least in the emergency department, is: sometimes yes. The researchers found that every increase in the model’s predicted fatigue score was linked to a 19 percent drop in the yield from a critical decision—testing for heart attacks, a life-or-death call in ER medicine. Instead of simply tracking the number of recent shifts, the model’s fine-grained, note-specific fatigue estimate proved more closely tied to this important performance measure. “Traditional measures of fatigue may not capture the nuance from encounter to encounter,” stated Tan. “As a result, it may not capture subtle shifts in decision quality, especially given that measurable decision signals can also be rare in healthcare. To give an example, it can take a long time to detect a misdiagnosis.” CAUTION FOR AI: MORE FATIGUED THAN THE DOCTOR? The study comes at a time when hospitals are looking to artificial intelligence for help with documentation, decision support, and even drafting parts of the clinical record. The researchers put popular AI language models to the same test—and found a surprising result: Notes drafted by large language models not only mimicked the “fatigued” patterns identified by the human-authored fatigue model, but did so even more strongly. In fact, the “fatigue” score for LLM-generated text was 74% higher than that of real physician notes. If these models are used indiscriminately to generate or summarize patient notes, they could, in effect, amplify the very communication problems linked to tired human doctors. “Writing is thinking,” said Tan. “AI may improve productivity and reduce physician fatigue, but it should not result in notes that ‘look’ fatigued.” TOWARDS RESPONSIBLE AI—AND BETTER CARE The authors urge caution, but also see opportunities. Instead of fully automating notes, AI could be used to help physicians focus on the most meaningful aspects of patient care—perhaps by flagging repetitive or predictable sections for streamline, or prompting for more nuanced observations. The findings have implications far beyond scribbles in the hospital’s back office. They suggest new benchmarks are needed—to ensure that both human and artificial authors of medical notes provide documentation that genuinely supports high-quality care, and to remind us that behind every line of text is a clinician, subject to the same daily rhythms and strains as anyone else. As hospitals and technology firms continue to roll out AI assistants, this research—rooted in the expertise of Professor Chenhao Tan and his colleagues—will be essential reading for everyone invested in the future of healthcare.

Artificial intelligence (AI) agents, autonomous goal directed programs, will play an increasingly important role in society as new discoveries make these agents more capable. AI agents may soon fulfill complex multistep requests, enabling more tasks previously reserved for humans to be completed by AI. These more-capable AI agents will likely have far-reaching impacts on politics, the economy, and society, raising new ethics and safety concerns. James Evans , Max Palevsky Professor of Sociology and Data Science at the University of Chicago, studies the human-AI relationship as Faculty Co-Director of the Data Science Institute’s Novel Intelligence research initiative. In a new Nature Comment , Evans and colleagues explore key challenges to ensuring human-AI agent interactions remain beneficial. They argue scientists, scholars, engineers, and policy-makers need greater engagement with the implications of a world increasingly populated by AI agents.

Data shapes our cultural, economic, and political lives. But data’s dynamics are complex and at their core is data’s mobility: it can move from one system, agent, or institution to another. Data’s promise and its puzzles lie in these dataflows and the ecology of structures and agents that produce and regulate them. Data ecology is not the product of technical systems, or social and financial incentives, or legal structures operating alone.  It is shaped by those interrelated forces acting together and controlling it requires interdisciplinary tools drawn from a range of fields, including data science, law, economics, and the humanities. The Data Ecology Research Initiative supports cross-disciplinary research, hosts scholarly convenings, engages public and private thinkers, and develops models of student instruction about data production, data movement, and data regulation. Leadership Bridget Fahey Assistant Professor, Law; Faculty Co-Director, Data Ecology Raul Castro Fernandez Assistant Professor, Computer Science; Faculty Co-Director, Data Ecology Michael J. Franklin Morton D. Hull Distinguished Service Professor; Senior Advisor to the Provost for Computing and Data Science; Faculty Co-Director, Data Science Institute Bridget Fahey is an Assistant Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School. Her research in constitutional law focuses on the theory and practice of American federalism, especially how our domestic governments interact in unexpected ways and use unorthodox legal tools to structure their joint projects. Her forthcoming co-authored article Layered Constitutionalism and Structural Interdependency , 124 Colum. L. Rev. (forthcoming 2024), identifies and theorizes a largely hidden body of federal constitutional rules that shape—in ways expected and unexpected—state structural choices. Her earlier article Coordinated Rulemaking and Cooperative Federalism’s Administrative State , 132 Yale L.J. 1213 (2023), argues that cooperative federalism programs have given rise to a distinctive administrative state—with forms of administrative action and legal frameworks that diverge in important respects from ordinary federal and state administrative law. The Article illustrates this point by identifying a distinctive form of legislative rulemaking—“coordinated rulemaking”—which is widely used in cooperative federalism programs, but cannot be assimilated into familiar administrative law frameworks. Her article Data Federalism , 135 Harv. L. Rev. 1107 (2022), uncovers a vast intergovernmental market in private data exchanged by federal, state, and local governments, and the unusual cross-governmental bureaucracies that govern that market. Both pieces expound on the insight she first developed in Federalism by Contract , 129 Yale L.J. 2326 (2020), which demonstrated that the federal government and states use contract-like instruments to structure intergovernmental programs and transact in a wide range of governmental powers. Before joining the faculty, her article Consent Procedures and American Federalism , 128 Harv. L. Rev. 1561 (2015), identified and theorized the federal government’s practice of using cooperative federalism programs to intervene in and reshape state and local governing processes. Professor Fahey is also interested in the government stewardship of private data. Building on Data Federalism , her cross-disciplinary work funded by a grant from the Neubauer Collegium aims to develop a descriptive and conceptual understanding of the legal-technical architectures that shape of how data moves between—and is controlled by—our domestic governments. Professor Fahey received a BA in Political Science from the University of Chicago and a JD from Yale Law School. Before joining the faculty, she was a litigator at the Washington DC office of WilmerHale, held a fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania Law School and was a law clerk on the DC Circuit and on the Supreme Court of the United States for Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Earlier in her career, Professor Fahey worked as a management consultant for the Boston Consulting Group in Chicago and Berlin. She teaches 1L Contracts and Constitutional Law, co-coordinates the Public Law Workshop, and has taught informal Greenberg Seminars on eclectic topics including Space Law, Order Without Law, Free Speech on Campus, and others. Raul Castro Fernandez is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. In his research he builds systems for discovering, preparing, and processing data .

The University of Chicago hosted the 2025 Midwest Machine Learning Symposium (MMLS) at the Reva and David Logan Center for the Arts June 23 rd and 24 th . Gathering over 250 researchers from across the region for two days of talks by experts in the field, poster presentations by up-and-coming researchers, and opportunities for networking, the annual event cultivated and showcased talent at all stages and fostered cross-institutional collaboration. MMLS brought together diverse perspectives, from theoretical computer scientists to applied researchers, from industry practitioners to academic scholars. Sessions illustrated the breadth of machine learning research happening across the region, and reflected both technical innovation and a dedication to responsible innovation. MMLS is committed to spotlighting and encouraging work by junior researchers and students, with dedicated “Lightning Talks” and poster sessions. Lightning Talk speakers included UChicago and Toyota Technical Institute at Chicago (TTIC) researchers Raphael Rossellini, Justin Wang, Chenxiao Wang, and Shuo Xie who covered areas from theoretical foundations to practical applications. Four poster sessions featured research by more than 75 students spanning topics from strategies to debias high-stakes decisions to an optimization tool designed to support financial decision-making , and gave attendees an opportunity to share ideas and build connections. The 2025 Symposium also featured plenary speakers at the cutting edge of ML research across each of their domains: Ben Zhao (University of Chicago) – Named to TIME Magazine’s TIME100 AI list, Zhao is a UChicago Computer Science professor whose work has led him in a direction he didn’t expect: advocacy for artists. Zhao spoke to the impacts of previous waves of innovation in computer science and what’s different this time, and shared the effects of AI he’s witnessed on independent artists. He also spoke about his team’s work on tools like Nightshade and Glaze to help artists protect their work from unauthorized AI model training, and the role the rising generation of engineers can play in mitigating the risks of AI. Tuomas Sandholm (Carnegie Mellon University) – Most real-world situations are situations with imperfect information. Games such as chess have long served as a benchmark for AI’s progress, and there have long existed imperfect information versions that require reasoning about information gathering as well as knowledge about one’s opponent: what they know, signal, or bluff on. Sandholm, the Angel Jordan University Professor of Computer Science at CMU and co-director of CMU AI, presented the latest advances in AI reasoning in cases of imperfect information, as demonstrated through examples from “Fog of War” chess. He presented his team’s work developing Obscuro, the first superhuman AI for fog of war chess, which shows strong reasoning even without the construction of a common knowledge set. Heng Ji (University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign) – Ji, Professor of Computer Science and Founding Director of the Amazon-Illinois Center on AI, discussed r ecent advances in block-based chemistry that involve breaking down molecules into building blocks (i.e., functional modules) and reassembling them into new molecules with desired functions. This offers the possibility to manually design drugs and materials. Ji shared her team’s work developing a prototype that employs multistep critical reasoning to rethink and resurrect “fallen angels:” pharmaceuticals that showed efficacy but ultimately failed clinical trials due to adverse effects. Of the 16 molecules the team analyzed, eight were able to be reformed, an outcome that offers the possibility to transform the notoriously time and money-intensive process of drug discovery. Sanjeev Arora (Princeton University) – Arora, the Charles C. Fitzmorris Professor of Computer Science and Director of Princeton Language and Intelligence, discussed how far LLMs have come in their problem-solving capabilities, and where they might go next. To learn how to think critically, humans need to be able to think about thinking and, Arora argued, the same is likely the case for LLMs, in which such “metacognition” tends to arise spontaneously. As machine learning continues to reshape industries and society, MMLS is dedicated to ensuring the Midwest is an active participant with its annual conferences. We hope you’ll join us next year for MMLS26, hosted by Purdue University.

To do this we partner with industry, social impact, civic organizations and research groups for 1 or 2 academic quarters on data science projects. As part of their training, students will be tasked with producing key deliverables, such as data analysis, open source software, as well as final client presentations and research reports. Each project is assigned a team of 2 to 5 students and a mentor. Mentors are assigned to each project to ensure projects are structured with frequent milestones and generate tangible results. Teams consist of undergraduate juniors and seniors or masters students drawing largely from data science, computer science, public policy, statistics, economics and additional appropriate domains of study. Students work with real-world (imperfect) datasets, apply models and algorithms to data, navigate security and privacy issues, communicate results to a diverse set of stakeholders, and translate information into actionable insight. Each team of students meet weekly with one or more of the course leadership team in an extended scrum format to review the past week’s progress, address challenges and questions, reflect on overall team progress and update the timeline and goals of the weeks ahead. Each student works 10-15 hours a week on the Clinic project. We work with our Clinic partners to scope projects, outline deliverables and place student teams onto these projects. Partners can expect the students to work diligently and take ownership of the project. Clinic partners provide a project appraisal that impacts finals grades. You can view more information about the DSI Clinic, including seeing past projects on our website here . As needed, mentors and students will sign a non-disclosure agreement at the company’s request and all IP generated by the project is retained by the Clinic partner. Participation in the Clinic is limited to organizations in our Industry Affiliates Program , our research collaborators, government and nonprofit organizations, and 11th Hour Project grantees.

The AI for Climate (AICE) Initiative at the University of Chicago builds upon the institution’s deep legacy in weather forecasting and climate science and rapid growth in artificial intelligence (AI) for science. AICE aims to leverage the power of AI and machine learning to accelerate and transform the theory and practice of weather and climate analysis and prediction. Launched in September 2024, this interdisciplinary effort combines climate physics, computer science, economics, applied and computational math, statistics, public health, and the social sciences to pioneer new models for climate and weather prediction and to inform global efforts on adaptation and resilience. “AICE is among the first of its kind at a university,” said Pedram Hassanzadeh , Faculty Director of AICE and an Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Computational and Applied Mathematics. “Other programs typically have a narrower scope that’s either limited to one or two disciplines or centered solely on deep learning applications as a new tool. By building a wide coalition of researchers, including those focused on socioeconomic impacts and adaptation and mitigation strategies, our program is helping position the University of Chicago as a leader in this space.” A joint program of UChicago’s Data Science Institute and the Institute for Climate and Sustainable Growth , AICE has already notched several early successes that have helped advance its mission to revolutionize and democratize climate science and weather forecasting. Here’s a look at some of its recent accomplishments. Expanding Access to Accurate Forecasts Pedram Hassanzadeh, Associate Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Faculty Director of AI for Climate One of AI’s biggest advantages is its ability to dramatically reduce the computational cost of running climate and weather models. “Traditional, physics-based models have grown more and more complex and expensive, with long-range forecasts requiring the world’s most powerful supercomputers,” said Hassanzadeh, who helped develop the first working AI-based weather forecast model, NVIDIA’s FourCastNet . “AI is far more efficient, for example, by a factor of 100,000. A properly trained high school student with a laptop can now produce state-of-the-art forecasts, though they would need help interpreting them.” This shift has profound implications for many around the world, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), which often lack access to high-performance computing but face acute risks from extreme heat and other climate impacts. “There is an urgent need for innovative solutions to address the growing impacts of climate change on vulnerable communities,” said Amir Jina, who co-leads AICE with Hassanzadeh. Jina is a development economist at the Harris School of Public Policy. “Our research has demonstrated that countries have an opportunity to better protect their economies from climate uncertainties by improving weather forecasting.” For example, research conducted by Jina and colleagues has shown that improved monsoon forecasts help farmers make better decisions—such as how much to plant, what to plant, or whether to plant at all—ultimately leading to smarter investments and greater resilience. “Through our projects, we aim to empower people  with actionable climate information, and ensure  they have the tools to adapt and thrive in an increasingly uncertain environment.” Amir Jina, Assistant Professor at the Harris School of Public Policy and Faculty Co-Director of the AI for Climate Initiative facilitates a panel discussion at COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan last November. The group has partnered with global efforts to enhance climate resilience, such as Agriculture Innovation Mission for Scale ( AIM for Scale )—a joint initiative between the United Arab Emirates and the Gates Foundation , for which Jina chairs the technical panel on weather forecasting. At COP29 , the UN’s most recent climate change conference, AIM for Scale announced a $1 billion package to boost weather services for farmers in LMICs, which included funding to support a research and training program led by AICE. AICE is developing state-of-the-art AI models and training government officials—initially from 30 countries in the tropics and global south—on how to use them effectively, in partnership with the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI) in the United Arab Emirates. Focus on the Long Term AICE also aims to improve its AI models for subseasonal to seasonal (S2S) weather forecasts. Current AI models outperform the physics-based models for 1- to 10-day forecasts, but like the physics-based models, do not offer much skill beyond these lead times. However, longer range forecasts, from around two weeks to 6 weeks, offer valuable climate insights and decision-making opportunities that shorter ones cannot, such as helping farmers to make strategic decisions on such concerns as crop planning, resource use, and risk management well in advance. Improving S2S forecasting requires large climate datasets, advanced computing power, and deep expertise in areas such as data science and climate domain science. UChicago’s partnership with Argonne National Laboratory plays a critical role in AICE’s efforts to improve S2S models. “Both institutions play a key role in developing successful AI for Climate projects. Each has AI and domain science expertise, while Argonne provides the exascale computing resources and the University brings the workforce needed to advance projects,” said Jiwen Fan , co-director of AICE and deputy division director of the Environmental Science Division at Argonne. “By combining our strengths, we can take a leadership role in the development of better S2S forecasts.” This partnership is also crucial to AICE’s work in climate science. Physics-based climate models currently serve as the gold standard for understanding historical climate patterns, projecting future trends, and testing adaptation, mitigation, and climate engineering strategies. Yet, just like traditional weather forecasting models, they are computationally expensive, as well as slow to run and challenging to scale. Tiffany Shaw, Professor of Geophysical Sciences and Faculty Director of AI for Climate presenting the team’s research into using AI to predict rare but catastrophic “gray swan” events. Scientists have recently begun turning to AI emulators to more quickly produce climate projections. These tools learn from decades of physics-based simulations and observational data, allowing researchers to quickly run many “what if” scenarios and explore possible futures more efficiently. These tools, however, come with challenges. Their accuracy depends heavily on the data they’re trained on, and they may struggle with unfamiliar or extreme situations. In fact, just recently, Hassanzadeh and colleagues showed the challenges of AI models with the rarest, most extreme weather events , so-called “gray swans,” calling for innovation at the intersection of AI, mathematics, and climate physics, one of the major goals of AICE. With these limitations in mind, researchers at AICE are working to benchmark and better understand AI climate emulators, testing how well their predictions match reality and where they fall short, to ensure they’re both fast and trustworthy. Such work can pinpoint where new innovations are needed to build better physics-informed AI tools for the next-generation of weather and climate modeling. This work, while in its infancy, holds the potential to democratize access to climate projections much in the same way AI can for weather forecasting. “If we can demonstrate that these emulators show considerable skill and reliability for rare and extreme events or for weather pattern changes, and build up a group who know how to use them, that could be transformative,” said Tiffany Shaw , Director of AICE and Professor of Geophysical Science. “That’s the real opportunity for AI tools like this – bringing new knowledge to more people who can use it to make strategic decisions while reducing the uncertainties we currently face.” People Pedram Hassanzadeh Associate Professor, Geophysical Sciences; Member, Committee of Computational and Applied Mathematics; Faculty Director, AI for Climate Amir Jina Assistant Professor, Harris School of Public Policy; Senior Fellow, Energy Policy Institute of Chicago; Faculty Co-Director, AI for Climate Tiffany Shaw Professor, Geophysical Sciences; Faculty Director, AI for Climate Jiwen Fan Deputy Division Director, Environmental Science Division, Argonne National Laboratory; UChicago CASE Senior Scientist Affiliate; Faculty Co-Director, AI for Climate Ian Foster Arthur Holly Compton Distinguished Service Professor, Department of Computer Science; Distinguished Fellow, MCS Division, Argonne; Senior Scientist, MCS Division, Argonne; Faculty Co-Director, AI for Climate Related Research Research Initiative AICE: AI for Climate DSI Data Science Institute John Crerar Library Building 5730 South Ellis Avenue, Suite 150 Chicago IL 60637 data-science@uchicago.edu © 2025 University of Chicago About People Research Education Outreach News Events Jobs Newsletter Archive Physical Sciences Division Nondiscrimination Statement Accessibility Contact Get Updated Newsletter Signup * Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra (offered by University College London) Basis Data Descriptors, Statistical Distributions, and Application to Business Decisions (offered by Rice University) Python for Data Science, AI, & Development (offered by IBM) Data Analysis with R Programming (offered by Google) Core Courses Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings. Statistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation. Machine Learning I This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies. Machine Learning II The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications. Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches. Leadership and Consulting for Data Science The Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on: • Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations • Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization • Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage This course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful. Data Science Capstone Project The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter. Sample Elective Courses Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’. Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques. Data Visualization Techniques In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards. Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives. Students will learn to identify the web analytic tool right for their specific needs; understand valid and reliable ways to collect, analyze, and visualize data from the web; and utilize data in decision making for their agencies, organizations or clients. By completing this course, students will gain an understanding of the motivations behind data collection and analysis methods used by marketing professionals; learn to evaluate and choose appropriate web analytics tools and techniques; understand frameworks and approaches to measuring consumers’ digital actions; earn familiarity with the unique measurement opportunities and challenges presented by New Media; gain hands-on, working knowledge of a step-by-step approach to planning, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data; utilize tools to collect data using today’s most important online techniques: performing bulk downloads, tapping APIs, and scraping webpages; and understand approaches to visualizing data effectively. Data Science for Healthcare Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial. Financial Analytics This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement. Generative AI Principles This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios. Machine Learning Operations The objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects.

Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors. For cognitive analytics section of the course, students will practice designing question answering systems with intent classification, semantic knowledge extraction and reasoning under uncertainty. Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding. Real Time Intelligent Systems Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems. Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.

When Ariel Azria, Kwaku Ofori-Atta, and Nathan Rickert walked into the 2025 Midwest Machine Learning Symposium on June 24th, they weren’t just attending. The three graduate students from the University of Chicago’s Master of Science in Applied Data Science program had been selected to share their capstone project, FinWise.AI , during the poster session. “It was awesome,” said Azria of the experience. “We put in a lot of research, and getting to present it in a space full of other machine learning researchers was phenomenal. It really felt like the hard work paid off.” How It Started But the journey to the symposium started months earlier, with an idea that looked quite different. Their first concept sounded like something out of Silicon Valley, a tool that could automatically manage someone’s finances, make smart decisions, and grow wealth with minimal user effort. But it was their capstone advisor, Justin Kurland, who steered them toward something more original. What was missing in the space, they realized, was a tool focused not on maximizing profits for the wealthy but on offering clarity, control, and trust for the people often left out of traditional banking systems. “We wanted to focus on a tool that matched our market opportunity,” said Rickert. “That was originally scoped during the preliminary phases, understanding our market segments and where there’s opportunity for the tool. That’s where we gravitated towards and framed the entire tool.” The result was FinWise.AI , a machine learning-powered platform designed to help unbanked and underbanked individuals navigate banking offers with confidence. The unbanked refer to people who do not have a checking or savings account, while the underbanked may have basic accounts but still rely on alternative financial services, like payday loans or check-cashing services, that often come with high fees and limited consumer protections. Optimizing for Financial Rewards The goal of FinWise.AI was to empower users to make banking decisions that felt both transparent and worthwhile. Many unbanked and underbanked individuals avoid traditional financial institutions due to a lack of trust, shaped by years of complex terms, hidden fees, and opaque practices. “We wanted to come up with a solution that helped people feel like they were in control of their financial situation… in a way that isn’t harmful to them, in a way that’s beneficial,” Azria said. To address that, the team built a preprocessing system that could quantify dense legal language such as costs, fees, restrictions, and regulatory red tape, and simplify it. Then came the challenge of optimization: developing an algorithm that could evaluate hundreds of constantly changing banking offers and recommend those where the potential benefits outweighed the risks. That’s where their three optimization methods came in. Rickert started with A*, a classic pathfinding algorithm, to set a baseline for how a user might move through the “space” of banking decisions. A* helps identify the best combination of bank offers while considering deposit limits, lock-up periods, and user eligibility rules. But A* had limitations. It struggled to generalize across different income levels, especially for low- and high-earners. Azria and Ofori-Atta then implemented two reinforcement learning approaches: Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). These methods allowed the model to simulate thousands of decision paths over time, adjusting strategies based on changing offers, income constraints, and long-term goals. “The reason we chose reinforcement learning is because the amount of offers available at any one time is changing,” said Ofori-Atta. “You have a dynamic state space, so traditional optimization techniques don’t really work. You need to dynamically optimize changing conditions.” Ultimately, PPO emerged as the most consistent and equitable method, delivering stable performance for users across all income brackets. From Theory to Recognition The invitation to present at the Midwest Machine Learning Symposium, hosted at the University of Chicago’s Logan Center for the Arts, was a milestone for the team. Their project, which had begun as a classroom assignment, now stood alongside work from researchers across the region. FinWise.AI also earned an Honorable Mention in the Winter 2025 Capstone Showcase, a recognition given to standout projects that demonstrated innovation, technical strength, and real-world potential. Rickert, who had followed the symposium for years, said it was a natural next step. “We were proud of what we’d built, and the poster session gave us a chance to share ideas with other scholars and see where our work fit in the broader machine learning community.” Beyond the Capstone For Ofori-Atta, the experience has shaped how he thinks about his work. “This project has shown me that there’s a lot of space for AI and optimization problems,” Ofori-Atta said. “I have a lot of experience teaching financial literacy to kids on the Southwest Side of Chicago, and what I learned from that is that it’s very difficult to reason about money—it’s emotional, and it’s also asymmetric. It’s hard to understand what you know versus what others know. So having AI level the playing field in that way is something I want to keep working on.” Related News Applied Data Science Jul 02, 2025 Hackathon Unites United Airlines and UChicago MS-ADS Students to Tackle Aviation with AI Applied Data Science May 29, 2025 First MS-ADS Conference Brings Alumni Together Campus News Jul 15, 2025 2025 Midwest Machine Learning Symposium Demonstrates Regional Excellence + Show All - Show Less Events Upcoming Event Aug 25, 2025 MS in Applied Data Science – Information Session (In-Person Program) Upcoming Event Aug 27, 2025 Ask A Student Information Session (Online Student) DSI Data Science Institute John Crerar Library Building 5730 South Ellis Avenue, Suite 150 Chicago IL 60637 data-science@uchicago.edu © 2025 University of Chicago About People Research Education Outreach News Events Jobs Newsletter Archive Physical Sciences Division Nondiscrimination Statement Accessibility Contact Get Updated Newsletter Signup * Email This field is for validation purposes and should be left unchanged.

Visit the Internet Innovation Initiative Data Portal Educational and economic opportunity, as well as health outcomes, depend on the availability of affordable, high-speed Internet access. The COVID-19 pandemic—and in particular society’s increasing reliance on reliable high-speed broadband Internet access during the crisis—has accelerated and magnified these existing disparities. As the essential tasks of living, such as learning, job seeking, and accessing health care, move online, Internet access is increasingly becoming an issue of educational equality and economic opportunity, one that disproportionately hurts low-income families and minorities. The lack of precise broadband deployment data complicates this issue and attempts to remedy the “digital divide.” Current FCC broadband maps rely on census block data that overestimates the number of households with Internet access and lacks fine-grained detail. With a grant from data.org , our team will innovate new, powerful data science approaches that gather and aggregate multiple data sources to produce accurate broadband maps. We will also create an Internet measurement and performance toolkit that will allow policymakers, administrators, and the public to locate and understand the gaps in Internet coverage and target critical resource investments among communities most in need. Interdisciplinary researchers at the University of Chicago, including the Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice and the Office of Civic Engagement , will work with Chicago Public Schools and civic non-profit organization Kids First and urban solutions accelerator City Tech Collaborative to develop technical tools and data that meet the needs of stakeholders and community members, reducing inequalities in high-speed Internet access.

Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra (offered by University College London) Basis Data Descriptors, Statistical Distributions, and Application to Business Decisions (offered by Rice University) Python for Data Science, AI, & Development (offered by IBM) Data Analysis with R Programming (offered by Google) Core Courses Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings. Statistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation. Machine Learning I This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies. Machine Learning II The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications. Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications. There is no single definition of big data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with it, and we will cover the most popular approaches. Leadership and Consulting for Data Science The Leadership and Consulting for Data Scientist course is focused on: • Learning techniques and proven methods to effectively grasp the business domain including organizational dynamics of consultancies and client organizations • Developing relevant solutions to enterprise problems using the sampling methods, traditional statistical techniques and modern machine learning models that deliver value to the organization • Practicing successful project delivery through effective data discovery, influential team membership and leadership, project management, and communication at every stage This course will not only make you a better data scientist; it will make you and your analyses more approachable, more persuasive, and ultimately more successful. Data Science Capstone Project The required Capstone Project is completed over two quarters and covers research design, implementation, and writing. Full-time students start their capstone project in their third quarter. Part-time students generally begin the capstone project in their fifth quarter. Sample Elective Courses Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’. Data Science for Algorithmic Marketing This course focuses on marketing science methods and algorithms for undertaking competitive analysis in the digital landscape: market segmentation, mining databases for effective digital marketing, design of new digital and traditional products, forecasting sales and product diffusion, real time product positioning, intra omni-channel optimization and inter omni-channel resource allocation, and pricing across both omni-channel marketing effectiveness and ROI. The course will use a combination of lecture, in-class discussions, group assignments, and a final group project. The course lays special emphasis on algorithms. Hence it draws heavily from the fields of optimization, machine-learning based recommendation systems, association rules, consumer choice models, Bayesian estimation, experimentation and analysis of covariance, advanced visualization techniques for mapping brand perceptions, and analysis of social media data using advanced NLP techniques. Data Science for Healthcare Given the breadth of the field of health analytics, this course will provide an overview of the development and rapid expansion of analytics in healthcare, major and emerging topical areas, and current issues related to research methods to improve human health. We will cover such topics as security concerns unique to the field, research design strategies, and the integration of epidemiologic and quality improvement methodologies to operationalize data for continuous improvement. Students will be introduced to the application of predictive analytics to healthcare. Students will understand factors impacting the delivery of quality and safe patient care and the application of data-driven methods to improve care at the healthcare system level, design approaches to answering a research question at the population level, become familiar with the application of data analytics to impacting care at the provider level through Clinical Decision Systems, and understand the process of a Clinical Trial. Data Visualization Techniques In today’s data driven enterprise, data storytelling using effective visualization strategies is an essential skill for analytics practitioners in almost every field to explore and present data. This course focuses on modern data visualization technologies, tools, and techniques to convert raw data into actionable information. Modern data visualization tools are at the forefront of the “self-service analytics” architectures which are decentralizing analytics and breaking down IT bottlenecks for business experts. Moreover, with its foundations rooted in statistics, psychology, and computer science, data visualization shows you how to better understand the data, present clear evidence of your findings to your intended audience and tell engaging data stories through charts and graphics. This course is designed to introduce data visualization as a medium of effective communication using strategic storytelling, and the basis for interactive information dashboards. Digital Marketing Analytics in Theory and Practice Successfully marketing brands today requires a well-balanced blend of art and science. This course introduces students to the science of web analytics while casting a keen eye toward the artful use of numbers found in the digital space. The goal is to provide marketers with the foundation needed to apply data analytics to real-world challenges they confront daily in their professional lives. Students will learn to identify the web analytic tool right for their specific needs; understand valid and reliable ways to collect, analyze, and visualize data from the web; and utilize data in decision making for their agencies, organizations or clients. By completing this course, students will gain an understanding of the motivations behind data collection and analysis methods used by marketing professionals; learn to evaluate and choose appropriate web analytics tools and techniques; understand frameworks and approaches to measuring consumers’ digital actions; earn familiarity with the unique measurement opportunities and challenges presented by New Media; gain hands-on, working knowledge of a step-by-step approach to planning, collecting, analyzing, and reporting data; utilize tools to collect data using today’s most important online techniques: performing bulk downloads, tapping APIs, and scraping webpages; and understand approaches to visualizing data effectively. Financial Analytics This course concentrates on the following topics: review of financial markets and assets traded on them; main characteristics of financial analytics: returns, yields, volatility; review of stochastic models of market price and their statistical representations; concept of arbitrage, elements of arbitrage pricing approach; principles of volatility analyses, implied vs. realized volatility; correlation, cointegration and other relationships between various financial assets; market risk analytics and management of portfolios of financial assets. The course puts special emphasis on covering main steps of building analytics from visualizing data and building intuition about their structure and patterns to selecting appropriate statistical method to interpretation of the results and building analytical models. Topics are illustrated by data analysis projects using R. Basic familiarity with R is a requirement. Generative AI Principles This course dives into the realm of Generative AI, offering a comprehensive look into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs), image generation techniques, and the fusion of vision and text through multimodal models. Drawing from core concepts in neural networks, transformers, and advanced techniques such as prompt engineering, vision prompting, and multimodality representation, students will explore the capabilities, applications, and ethical considerations of generative models. This course culminates in hands-on projects, allowing participants to apply theory to practical scenarios. Machine Learning Operations The objective of this course is two-fold: first, to understand what Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) is and why it is a key component in enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects, and second, to expose students to software engineering, model engineering and state-of-the-art deployment engineering with hands-on platform and tools experience. This course crosses the chasm that separates machine learning projects/experiments and enterprise production deployment. It covers three pillars in MLOps: software engineering such as software architecture, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery and data versioning; model engineering such as AutoML and A/B experimentation; and deployment engineering such as docker containers and model monitoring. The course focuses on best practices in the industry that are critical to enterprise production deployment of machine learning projects. Having completed this course, a student understands the machine learning lifecycle and what it takes to go from ideation to operationalization in an enterprise environment. Furthermore, students get exposure to state-of-the-art MLOps platforms such as allegro, xpresso, Dataiku, LityxIQ, DataRobot, AWS Sagemaker, and technologies such as gitHub, Jenkins, slack, docker, and kubernetes. Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Computing Extracting actionable insights from unstructured text and designing cognitive applications have become significant areas of application for analytics. Students in this course will learn foundations of natural language processing, including: concept extraction; text summarization and topic modeling; part of speech tagging; named entity recognition; semantic roles and sentiment analysis. For advanced NLP applications, we will focus on feature extraction from unstructured text, including word and paragraph embedding and representing words and paragraphs as vectors.

Students will gain hands-on expertise applying Python for text analysis tasks, as well as practice with multiple IBM Watson services, including: Watson Discovery, Watson Conversation, Watson Natural Language Classification and Watson Natural Language Understanding. Real Time Intelligent Systems Developing end-to-end automation and intelligent systems is now the most advanced area of application for analytics. Building such systems requires proficiency in programming, understanding of computer systems, as well as knowledge of related analytical methodologies, which are the skills that this course aims to teach to students. The course focuses on python and is tailored for students with basic programming knowledge in python. The course is partially project based. During the first three sessions, we will review basic python concepts and then learn more advanced python and the ways to use python to handle large data flows. The later sessions are project based and will focus on developing end-to-end analytical solutions in the following areas: Finance and trading, blockchains and crypto-currencies, image recognition, and video surveillance systems. Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain. Students will also learn how to optimize the performance of the Supply Chain from the lens of multiple related disciplines including: Sales Forecasting, Warehousing/Inventory Management, Promotion, Pricing, Logistics Network Optimization, Freight Cost Management, Manufacturing, Retail POS Information, Ecommerce, Consumer Data, and Product Design/Packaging. After completing this course, you will be prepared to work in any of the numerous specialty areas possible in the world of Supply Chain Management.

Mathematics for Machine Learning: Linear Algebra (offered by University College London) Basis Data Descriptors, Statistical Distributions, and Application to Business Decisions (offered by Rice University) Python for Data Science, AI, & Development (offered by IBM) Data Analysis with R Programming (offered by Google) Core Courses Time Series Analysis and Forecasting Time Series Analysis is a science as well as the art of making rational predictions based on previous records. It is widely used in various fields in today’s business settings. Statistical Models for Data Science In a traditional linear model, the observed response follows a normal distribution, and the expected response value is a linear combination of the predictors.  Since Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777-1855) and Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833) created this linear model framework in the early 1800s, the “Linear Normal” assumption has been the norm in statistics/data science for almost two centuries.  New methods based on probability distributions other than Gaussian appeared only in the second half of the twentieth century. These methods allowed working with variables that span a broader variety of domains and probability distributions. Besides, methods for the analysis of general associations were developed that are different from the Pearson correlation. Machine Learning I This course is aimed at providing students an introduction to machine learning with data mining techniques and algorithms. It gives a rigorous methodological foundation in analytical and software tools to successfully undertake projects in Data Science. Students are exposed to concepts of exploratory analyses for uncovering and detecting patterns in multivariate data, hypothesizing and detecting relationships among variables, conducting confirmatory analyses, and building models for predictive and descriptive purposes. It will present predictive modeling in the context of balancing predictive and descriptive accuracies. Machine Learning II The objective of this course is three-folds–first, to extend student understanding of predictive modeling with machine learning concepts and methodologies from Machine Learning 1 into the realm of Deep Learning and Generative AI. Second, to develop the ability to apply those concepts and methodologies to diverse practical applications, evaluate the results and recommend the next best action. Third, to discuss and understand state-of-the machine learning and deep learning research and development and their applications. Data Engineering Platforms for Analytics or Big Data and Cloud Computing Data Engineering Platforms teaches effective data engineering—an essential first step in building an analytics-driven competitive advantage in the market. Big Data and Cloud Computing teaches students how to approach big data and large-scale machine learning applications.

Sample Elective Courses Advanced Computer Vision with Deep Learning Computer vision is the field of computer science that focuses on creating digital systems that can process, analyze, and make sense of visual data in the same way that humans do. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning and a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It involves the training, deployment, and application of large complex neural network architectures to solve cutting-edge problems. Deep Learning has become the primary approach for solving cognitive problems such as Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing (NLP) and has had a massive impact on various industries such as healthcare, retail, automotive, industrial automation, and agriculture. This course will enable students to build Deep Learning models and apply them to computer vision tasks such as object recognition, detection, and segmentation. Students will gain an in-depth understanding of the Deep Learning model development process, tools, and frameworks. Although the focus of the course will primarily be computer vision, students will work on both image and nonimage datasets during class exercises and assignments. Students will gain hands-on experience in popular libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, and PyTorch. Students will also learn to apply state of the art models such as ResNet, EfficientNet, RCNNs, YOLO, Vision Transformers, etc. for computer vision and work on datasets such as CIFAR, ImageNet, MS COCO, and MPII Human Poses. Advanced Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence Since the era of big data started, challenges associated with data analysis have grown significantly in different directions: First, the technological infrastructure had to be developed that can hold and process large amounts of data from different sources and of multiple not always well formalized formats. Second, data analysis methods had to be reviewed, selected and modified to work in distributed computational environments like combinations of in-house clusters of servers and cloud. But the biggest challenge of all is learning to think differently in order to ask new types of questions that could not be answered by analyses of less complex data streams with less complex technological infrastructure. In recent years significant progress has been achieved in creating technological ecosystems for big data analysis. Innovative technologies such as open source projects MapReduce, Hadoop, Spark, Storm, Kafka, TensorFlow, H2O, etc. allowed us to look at depths of data unseen before. We now have a growing number of sources and educational courses introducing these new tools. However, developing new data analysis methods appropriate to these new data ecosystems is more difficult than it appears. Bayesian Machine Learning with Generative AI Applications This course provides a strong theoretical and practical skillset for probabilistic machine learning applications. Bayesian inference and modeling methods are important for several areas including prediction, decision making, and risk assessment where modeling the uncertainty is needed. The course begins with an introduction to Bayesian statistical analysis, covering the foundations of Bayesian inference and the application of Bayes’ theorem for statistical inference. We then introduce Bayesian networks, which offer a powerful graphical tool for modeling complex systems and making probabilistic inferences. The course then advances to cover more sophisticated topics such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for sampling from complex probability distributions, hierarchical models, and model selection techniques. The final three weeks are dedicated to cutting-edge methodologies like Generative Deep Learning, Variational Autoencoders, and Bayesian Neural Networks, all rooted in Bayesian Machine Learning. Upon completion, students will be equipped to apply Bayesian methods to a wide range of real-world problems in fields such as engineering, business, finance, and public policy, addressing challenges like missing data or training AI models that are able to say ‘I don’t know’.

Reinforcement Learning This course is an introduction to reinforcement learning, also known as neuro-dynamic programming. It discusses basic and advanced concepts in reinforcement learning and provides several practical applications. Reinforcement learning refers to a system or agent interacting with an environment and learning how to behave optimally in such an environment. An environment typically includes time, actions, states, uncertainty and rewards. Reinforcement learning combines neural networks and dynamic programming to find an optimal behavior or policy of the system or agent in a complex environment setting. Neural network approximations are used to circumvent the well-known ‘curse of dimensionality’ which has been a barrier to solving many practical applications. Dynamic programming is the key learning mechanism that the system or the agent uses to interact with the environment and improve its performance. Students will master key learning techniques and will become proficient in applying these techniques to complex stochastic decision processes and intelligent control. Supply Chain Optimization “Big Data” continues to grow exponentially in our large-scale transactional world where 100,000s of SKUs and millions of customers are interacting with 1:1 offers that include differential pricing, shipping timing/costs and even made to order “custom” product configurations. These consumer behaviors are quickly advancing the availability of new data and techniques within the discipline of Data Science. This elective course will give students the opportunity to apply their skills in data visualization, data mining tools, predictive modeling, and advanced optimization techniques to address Supply Chain challenges. The course focuses on the use of Advanced Predictive Modeling, Machine Learning, AI and other Data Science insight and activation tools to automate and optimize the performance of the Supply Chain.

Petabytes of data are being collected from a myriad of instruments, like sequencing machines for genomics and mobile devices for quantifying social interactions. In addition to driving research, data are shaping the way people work, live, and communicate. Correspondingly, new methodologies have emerged to power intelligent systems, make more accurate predictions, and gain new insight using the large volumes of data generated by scientists, entrepreneurs, and analysts. The field of Data Science has emerged to respond to the data revolution, and the necessity to responsibly store, process, analyze, and interpret data. Transdisciplinary by nature, Data Science draws on numerous fields including statistics, computer science and applied mathematics, and also incorporates topics in privacy and ethics, philosophy of science, and economics to better understand the impact of data on society. Therefore, the Data Science curriculum combines computational and analytical skills, extensive knowledge in the domain of application, communication skills, and an emphasis on ethical considerations. The data science program offers BA and BS degrees, as well as a minor. The minor program in data science is intended to equip students with computational and analytical comprehension and tools that will allow them to work on a variety of data-driven problems in any discipline while emphasizing important issues in data privacy, ethics, and communication. The major has several tracks that can serve different interests. Students have the possibility to pursue a program suited for a double major, and/or suited for graduate studies in data science and related fields. Students majoring in Data Science as well as those who are majoring in other fields of study and want to complete a minor in Data Science are encouraged to discuss their course choices with the Director of Undergraduate Studies.

Earlier this year, the UChicago Data Science Society brought alums back to campus to talk about their careers applying data science for social impact. After completing their masters’ degrees, both Jomana Abdelrahman (MAPSS ’23) and Robert (Bobby) Surridge (MSCAPP ’24) went on to Parliament Data , an analytics consultancy focused on the social sector. Abdelrahman, a Research and Data Analyst at Parliament, and Surridge, a Data Sciences & Visualization Associate, joined current students to share a look into what they’ve learned so far. Events like this one, hosted by the Data Science Society, invite students to think broadly about possible avenues to apply data science, and the diverse career paths open to them after graduation. Sessions also create opportunities for DSI’s network of industry partners such as Parliament to connect with interested students, and allow students to hear from near-peers about their experiences and the skills they’ll need so they can start building them on campus, whether through coursework or experiential learning in the Data Science Clinic . Abdelrahman and Surridge shared how their data science education has enabled them to contribute to a diverse set of community organizations and stakeholders at the Chicago-based advisory to nonprofit leaders, public officials, social entrepreneurs and funders. As an illustrative example, they walked students through their work on artlook , Parliament’s national asset mapping platform that empowers cities to identify and address gaps in arts education access for students. Asked for insight into their day-to-day and the skills needed to succeed in their line of work, Abdelrahman and Surridge emphasized the importance of being able to use data and visualizations to tell a story, to illustrate why an issue matters, or how a proposed solution could address it . They also spoke about the iterative process of working with clients to understand and meet their needs. When asked how recent advances in AI and machine learning have impacted their work, they provided insights into the evolution of the data discovery process given innovations in predictive modeling. Abdelrahman and Surridge also offered students advice on looking for data science jobs in the social sector and answered audience questions afterward. Thank you to Bobby and Jomana for sharing their experiences and giving students a glimpse into how they can apply their skills to careers in social impact.

The AI+Science Initiative at the University of Chicago Data Science Institute is developing a new paradigm of AI-enabled scientific discovery across the sciences, advancing core AI principles, and training a new generation of diverse interdisciplinary scientists. As part of this mission, the Initiative hosts the Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship Seminar Series , which brings researchers at the vanguard of such scientific discovery to UChicago’s campus. Across disciplines, from robotics and climate science to materials discovery and computational biology, this year’s speakers explored fundamental questions about AI’s possibilities in research while demonstrating practical applications already affecting people today. The series featured 23 experts accelerating materials and drug discovery through AI, including some here on campus: Chibueze Amanchukwu (Neubauer Family Asst. Professor; Faculty Co-Director of AI+Science) shared his work using machine learning (ML) to accelerate decarbonization. Although many possible battery chemistries exist, he explained, most can’t be used beyond the lab because we lack electrolyte solvents to deploy them affordably, efficiently, and safely. While hundreds of thousands of molecules exist that could potentially work, previous research has explored fewer than 1000 of them. Amanchukwu’s team is using ML to predict electrolyte conductivity, stability, and efficiency, exploding the potential for compound discovery from an average of three new compounds discovered per year to seven. This increased diversity offers more options to optimize for a particular goal, be it environmental impact or performance. Amanchukwu’s team includes Ritesh Kumar , a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow and one of Amanchukwu’s mentees. Claire Donnat (Assistant Professor of Statistics) discussed her work developing alternative statistical approaches to analyzing text for biomedical applications. Topic modeling is used to discover latent structures in text, but existing Bayesian approaches to improve estimation lack theoretical guarantees and are computationally high cost. Donnat, who will also serve as a mentor to a Fellow in the incoming cohort of Schmidt AI in Science Fellows this fall, shared two alternatives her team has proposed that establish high-probability bounds on estimation error and demonstrate validated improvements in topic inference. Aaron Dinner (Professor of Chemistry; Faculty Co-Director of AI+Science), who was recently appointed as a new faculty co-lead of the Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship Program, shared his work leveraging ML to elucidate complex reaction mechanisms and their kinetics beyond traditional theories. The breadth of expertise across departments exemplified how UChicago fosters interdisciplinary collaboration. The series also brought to campus experts in the field such as Anne Siegel , Deputy Scientific Director of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), who presented her research using machine learning to enhance analysis of diverse biomarkers by identifying discriminant biomarkers between ecosystems (metabarcoding). Siegel, who collaborates with Cathy Pfister , Professor of Ecology and Evolution at UChicago and also a mentor to an incoming Schmidt AI in Science Fellow, discussed functional applications of metabarcoding such as identifying species driving key functions in bioreactors or species essential in extreme environments based on their functions. Rose Yu , Associate Professor at UC San Diego, presented Physics-Guided Deep Learning in AI, a framework that aims to integrate first-principled physics knowledge into data-driven methods, offering the potential to significantly improve AI models’ sample complexity, computational efficiency, prediction accuracy, and scientific validity. Yu’s work is already yielding real-world impact, from improving traffic forecasts in Google Maps to contributing to the CDC’s mortality projections for COVID-19. Each presentation was followed by a Q&A and reception where speakers and attendees could continue the conversation—learning from applications across disciplines, and tapping into the UChicago research community’s diverse perspectives and expertise. Seminar Series speakers are selected and hosted by the Schmidt AI in Science Fellows , who are postdoctoral researchers across departments at the University of Chicago. Georgios Valogiannis , a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow whose work focuses on applying AI to problems in cosmology and astronomy, said of his experience as a member of the Organizing Committee: “I had the opportunity to engage with leading experts [in my field] such as Shirley Ho (Simons Foundation), Michelle Ntampaka (Space Telescope Science Institute), and Benjamin Wandelt (Johns Hopkins University).” Valogiannis added, “Their talks not only showcased cutting-edge work—on topics like foundation models for astronomy, robust and interpretable machine learning, and field-level inference—but also sparked valuable discussions that continue to shape my thinking… Hearing from researchers across domains encouraged me to think more broadly about methodological parallels and potential collaborations beyond my immediate field.” As artificial intelligence continues to reshape scientific research, the Schmidt AI in Science Fellowship Seminar Series fosters conversations and collaborations and provides a forum for the emerging community of AI in Science researchers to share methodological advances, discuss challenges, and prepare the next generation of researchers to drive scientific discovery with AI. Many thanks to our speakers and to everyone who attended throughout the year, and to Schmidt Sciences for making the Seminar Series possible. The schedule for next year’s Seminar Series will be announced in the fall. For more information, keep an eye on the Seminar Series page here .

Our goal is to create a continuous, evolving computer science pathway for students, allowing them to smoothly transition from the basics of computing through high school to college and beyond. Activities at the workshop include: Learning the Python programming language (no prior knowledge of Python necessary) Conducting inquiry-driven research in small groups Training on how to investigate data problems and present findings Developing critical collaboration, problem-solving, and communication skills Data4All is open to high school sophomores, juniors, and seniors who have completed Algebra 1. The program lasts 8 weeks, with students meeting on Saturdays at the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park, Chicago. OVERVIEW The Data4All High School Bridge Workshop was developed to serve as a transition from introductory computer science classes to data science research. The workshop introduces students to the data science research lifecycle, essential computational skills needed for data analysis and visualization, and provides training on how to communicate their findings. The workshop focuses on creating a continuous learning environment from students’ structured classroom studies to more experimental, inquiry-driven research work in small groups. Read more about the March 2021 inaugural workshop here . MOTIVATION In most Chicago Public High Schools (CPS), students’ exposure to computer science is limited to one computer science survey course, with limited exposure to advanced topics such as artificial intelligence, data science, or application of computer science to societal issues. This lack of opportunity continues to be perpetuated when students seek internships and other employment experiences and do not have the confidence in their own knowledge to see computer science, data science or artificial intelligence as a possible career pathway for themselves. To address this need, a team of researchers and educators from Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Chicago developed a data science bridge workshop that supports students from Chicago’s South Side community to develop a deeper understanding of data science and grow a tangible skill set that is grounded in scientific projects, real-world datasets, and professional tools. Through this program students will explore the foundational concepts of computer science and data science, working with authentic and complex datasets and leveraging principles of AI to gain insights from data and make predictions. WORKSHOP FOCUS & APPROACH The workshop is taught by using case studies that contain a real-world scientific challenge (i.e. COVID-19), an authentic data set and associated professional tools. The case studies are supplied from data generated by scientific research projects from the three institutions. Using the Python language, students explore data structures with an emphasis on multidimensional arrays, manipulating and visualizing them with commonly used libraries in scientific computing such as NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib. The datasets provide students with many of the challenges associated with scientific data and provide them with the skills to perform statistical analysis and prediction all the while exploring real-world problems. The workshop models the collaborative nature of computer science by situating students in teams with guidance and support of staff, including undergraduate and graduate mentors from the three institutions.

Eight Eric and Wendy Schmidt AI in Science Fellows are moving on to exciting new roles at leading global institutions in academia and industry. A program of Schmidt Sciences, the AI in Science Fellowship provides early career scholars with training and support to accelerate discovery across the natural sciences and AI. During their Fellowship, Fellows have the opportunity to pursue independent, original research integrating AI methods within their primary research disciplines, spanning departments across the UChicago campus from radiology to cosmological physics. The uniquely interdisciplinary nature of the Fellowship allows early researchers to investigate AI and machine learning approaches to forge new methods in their own fields. Schmidt AI in Science Fellows also benefit from the experience and perspectives of peers across other diverse fields: Peter Lu, an outgoing Fellow, emphasized the synergistic benefits to his own work, saying the program “has been really ideal for my type of interdisciplinary research [and] provides the freedom for me to work across different departments… Being able to collaborate with folks on very different projects and think about how these different machine learning tools are going to be helpful for a wide variety of people…has been really useful for me.” “The Fellows’ success on the academic job market underscores the strength of their research and of our Fellowship program,” said DSI’s Faculty Director of AI and Worah Family Professor of Statistics and Computer Science in the Wallman Society of Fellows Rebecca Willett .

It is an act of constitutional restructuring, and should be understood in those terms. Musk’s team has accessed a Department of Treasury database that guides the disbursement of more than $5 trillion in federal funds. It is tussling with senior officials at the Internal Revenue Service over access to tax returns, among the most protected federal data, and at the Social Security Administration over access to data systems containing medical and bank records. A court has temporarily blocked Musk and his team from obtaining data about millions of Americans’ student loans, but only for now. And just last week, Musk sought access to “the most sensitive of all” : a database reflecting ongoing wage and income information for most working Americans. The Constitution distributes power among the branches of government to prevent its concentration and maintain its balance. It organizes many different forms of power, but particularly significant are the powers that take the form of “instruments,” to borrow James Madison’s term for the government’s material tools. Chief among them, the Constitution commits the “power of the purse” to Congress. By contrast, only the president can wield the power of the sword as the commander in chief of the armed forces. Those two profound instruments, guided by different branches, can also counterbalance each other, as when Congress withholds funding for disfavored armed interventions.

As text generators and AI-driven artists become household names, a pressing question emerges: How do these tools decide what’s safe to share—and what isn’t? A recent study led by PhD student Lan Gao and undergraduate students Oscar Chen and Rachel Lee, together with Neubauer Professor Nick Feamster , Associate Professor Chenhao Tan , and Associate Professor Marshini Chetty of the Department of Computer Science , peels back the curtain on content moderation in consumer-facing generative AI products, exploring both the policies written by companies and the lived experiences of everyday users. FROM COMMUNITY RULES TO AI TOOLKITS Online communities have long balanced the need for open dialogue with safeguards against harmful content. Now, as platforms like ChatGPT, Midjourney, and Gemini churn out creative content for millions, the responsibility for content moderation enters new territory. Unlike message boards where only the uploaded posts are checked, these AI tools must also judge the user instructions they’re given—and the responses they generate. The research team first analyzed the public policies of 14 popular generative AI tools. They found that while most platforms are diligent about outlining what’s prohibited—ranging from hate speech to copyright violations—the actual guidance is often buried in a maze of terms, FAQs, and support pages. Few spell out exactly how users can report issues, or how they can appeal a moderation decision. In fact, “user-driven moderation” is mentioned far less than in traditional online communities. MODERATION: SUCCESSES AND STICKING POINTS To understand how these policies play out in the real world, the team dove into public Reddit discussions, pulling from over a thousand posts about content moderation in generative AI tools. Their analysis reveals a nuanced landscape: Successes: Users generally reported that obvious malicious content (think explicit imagery or scams) is blocked effectively—a relief for those concerned about the risks of AI-generated harm. Frustrations: Innocent creative tasks frequently get tangled in the filters. Fiction writers lamented blocks on violence in historical or fantasy stories; artists hit brick walls over ambiguous word choices. “I just find myself afraid of triggering arbitrary warnings, and then just not using it,” one user reflected. Lead phd student, Lan Gao Inconsistencies also frustrated users. Identical requests could get different moderation outcomes, sometimes seemingly dependent on luck — or the particular account being used. Explanations were often generic, with little insight into what went wrong or how to fix it. Appeals, when available, could move at a glacial pace. “From what we saw in these discussions, the technical limitations and the opaque disclosures of the moderation systems have hampered the users’ creativity and sense of agency with generative AI tools,” said Gao. “These drawbacks could subtly affect how users approach risks associated with AI tools, and shift user’s personal expressions from their original purpose.” WHY IT MATTERS BEYOND THE SCREEN The implications ripple far beyond hobbyists and tinkerers. In classrooms, journalism, design firms, and beyond, people rely on generative AI tools both for creative inspiration and practical assistance. Overly strict filters and inconsistent enforcement don’t just cause headaches—they risk cutting off valuable new forms of expression and utility. The study recommends that generative AI platforms unify and clarify their policies, offer meaningful feedback on moderation decisions, and adopt “soft moderation” (such as warnings rather than outright blocks) where possible. Involving users more directly in reporting and appeals could help platforms learn from mistakes and fine-tune their algorithms. Finally, making the moderation rules and processes more transparent—including the list of banned terms and how decisions are made—could demystify the process for users and enhance trust. “As generative AI has quickly taken off in the last few years, tool makers have had to put guardrails in place to prevent the creation and distribution of malicious content,” said Chetty. “By improving the transparency and effectiveness of content moderation policies in generative AI tools, we can encourage users to satisfy their curiosity while also minimizing harm.“ LOOKING AHEAD As generative AI becomes ever more woven into daily life, the study’s authors hope these findings will guide both policymakers and product designers. The full study will be presented at the 34th Annual USENIX Security Symposium in August and the related datasets are publicly available for those interested in delving deeper.

What courses will I take in the MBA/MS program? As a student in the joint-degree MBA and Applied Data Science program , you’ll take the equivalent of 23 100-unit courses: 14 MBA classes 9 data science courses Leadership Effectiveness and Development (LEAD) Qualified Work Experience, a noncredit professional internship experience Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. Will MBA/MS courses be in-person or online? Your Booth courses will be in person, while your MS courses will be online. Most students will earn both degrees in seven quarters—the same time it takes to earn the MBA. A combination of online and in-person courses gives you flexibility in course scheduling, and you’ll earn two degrees in the time it would take to complete the MBA alone. Are standardized tests required for admission? As part of the online application, candidates will be required to submit a GMAT or GRE score for the joint program. International applicants may be required to submit proof of English language proficiency by submitting a TOEFL iBT or IELTS test score. The minimum TOEFL iBT score required for admission is 104; the minimum IELTS score required is 7. Proof of English proficiency may be waived under certain criteria noted by UChicago GRAD Admissions. What are the main differences in programs and outcomes between the MBA/MS in Applied Data Science compared to Computer Science? The fields of Statistics, Mathematics, and Computer Science intersect with industry domains in different ways. The MPCS program focuses on the center of Computer Science, including Software Engineering, High Performance Computing, Data Analytics, and Application Development. The MS-ADS Program focuses at the intersection of multiple fields, such as Computer Science, Mathematics, and Statistics (including Statistical Inference, Linear/Non-Linear Models, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Deep Learning). The outcomes for MPCS students include Software Engineer (Developer), Senior Software Engineering Management, Software/Hardware Architect, and Senior Cyber Security Engineer. The outcomes for students in MS-ADS include roles as Data Scientist (most common), Senior Data Science Consultant, Business Intelligence (BI) Director, Data Visualization Manager, Data Analytics Engineer, and AI Solution Architect. 2-Year Thesis Track Program What is the new 2-year thesis track program (18 courses), and how is it different from the 1-year program (12 courses)? Beginning in academic 2026-27, a limited number of In-Person, Full-Time students will have the opportunity to complete a 2-year version of the MS in Applied Data Science program. The 2-year program is completed over 21 months (2 academic years). Students in the 2-year program will complete 18 instead of 12 courses. The additional 6 courses consist of 4 additional elective courses (100 units each); and 2 required thesis courses (100 units each) that culminate in the completion of a required written thesis or thesis project. The thesis will be an extension of students’ previously completed Capstone Project. 2-year program students are highly encouraged to complete a research Capstone (as compared to a traditional, industry Capstone) for various reasons. The longer degree timeline offers more time to engage in academic and professional development while maintaining the same rigorous core curriculum and access to UChicago’s faculty and data science network. The first 12 of 18 courses that students complete in the 2-year program follow exactly the same course progression as those in the 1-year, 12-course program. The 2-year program is not currently available to those in the Online program and/or those pursuing the MS in Applied Data Science on a part-time basis. When can I apply for the 2-year thesis track program? The application portal for the 2-year full-time option will open in September 2025 . Applicants apply through the same portal as the standard MS in Applied Data Science program. The deadline to be considered for this track is November 6, 2025 . There are a limited number of spots available in this new 2-year thesis track (18 courses) program. Those who are not admitted to the 2-year program will be automatically considered for the 1-year 12 course program unless they choose to opt-out of consideration. May I switch between the 1- and 2-year programs after officially enrolling in the MS-ADS program? No. Once admitted to the 1-year program, there is no opportunity to enroll in the 2-year program. Those admitted to the 2-year program might, under extenuating case by case circumstances, graduate early after completing the initial 12 courses of the MS degree (4-5 quarters). Any such student must meet with program faculty and staff by the required deadlines in order to maintain good academic standing and/or visa compliance (if applicable). If I am admitted to the In-Person, Full-Time 1-year program, may I take any of the 2-year program electives? No, due to the limited number of spots available for the new 2-year program, the electives are reserved for only those students admitted to the 2-year program specifically. Should anything change, students will be notified. What is the 2-year program's thesis requirement? Those admitted to the full-time, in-person thesis track pathway (18 courses, 6 quarters of coursework) are required to complete and submit a written thesis. The thesis will be an individually authored text based on an area of interest from students’ Research Capstone Project. The thesis will be managed through the required thesis courses (2, 100 units each). A lead faculty member with knowledge of the student’s area of interest will supervise the thesis project and provide resources and support as needed. As an alternative to a traditional written thesis, students may opt to complete a thesis project that results in a ‘minimum viable product’ project. Through this option, students will complete a rigorous, multi-step ‘build’ and ‘marketing’ phase throughout the required 2 thesis courses. The thesis project will also be supervised by a program faculty member. How many spots are available in the new 2-year program? While subject to change, there are a projected ~50-55 spots available for the 2-year program. For application year 2025-26 (for entrance in autumn 2026), applicants must apply by the first application deadline (November 6, 2025) in order to be considered for the 2-year program. Students admitted to the 2-year program will take the same 12 courses as those in the 1-year program, but they will complete 6 more courses over 2 additional quarters in their 2nd year of study for a total of 18 courses.

To get involved in the Novel Intelligence research community and receive updates about upcoming events and opportunities, please sign up for the Novel Intelligence email list . The notion of an Artificial Intelligence (AI) that computationally mimics human intelligence has dominated the design of computational intelligence, but is tuned to replace humanity rather than augment its capacity. Rather than targeting Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), we argue that AI should be designed to complement individual and collective human capacity, avoid humanity’s blind spots, overcome cognitive and cultural limitations, and unleash novel senses, skills, and imagination. This initiative addresses new and complex questions regarding how to build AI models without targeting but rather expanding human capacity. This research initiative will integrate with social and behavioral sciences to identify and monitor changing human limitations and opportunities. It will also draw on business and economics to measure and model human-AI productivity; legal and policy expertise to propose models by which AI can assist in the regulation of other AI; and tools and insight across the sciences, engineering, arts, and humanities to align AI with human needs and values. These efforts will grow human-AI potential to grapple with the greatest challenges facing humanity together. Leadership James Evans Max Palevsky Professor of Sociology & Data Science; Director, Knowledge Lab; Faculty Co-Director, Novel Intelligence Chenhao Tan Associate Professor of Computer Science and Data Science; Faculty Co-Director, Novel Intelligence My research focuses on the collective system of thinking and knowing, ranging from the distribution of attention and intuition, the origin of ideas and shared habits of reasoning to processes of agreement (and dispute), accumulation of certainty (and doubt), and the texture—novelty, ambiguity, topology—of understanding. I am especially interested in innovation—how new ideas and practices emerge—and the role that social and technical institutions (e.g., the Internet, markets, collaborations) play in collective cognition and discovery. Much of my work has focused on areas of modern science and technology, but I am also interested in other domains of knowledge—news, law, religion, gossip, hunches, machine and historical modes of thinking and knowing. I support the creation of novel observatories for human understanding and action through crowd sourcing, information extraction from text and images, and the use of distributed sensors (e.g., RFID tags, cell phones). I use machine learning, generative modeling, social and semantic network representations to explore knowledge processes, scale up interpretive and field-methods, and create alternatives to current discovery regimes. My research has been supported by the National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, the Air Force office of Science Research, and many philanthropic sources, and has been published in Nature , Science , Proceedings of the National Academy of Science , American Journal of Sociology , American Sociological Review , Social Studies of Science , Research Policy, Critical Theory, Administrative Science Quarterly , and other outlets. My work has been featured in the Economist , Atlantic Monthly , Wired , NPR , BBC , El País , CNN, Le Monde, and many other outlets. At Chicago, I am Director of Knowledge Lab , which has collaborative, granting and employment opportunities, as well as ongoing seminars. I also founded and now direct on the Computational Social Science program at Chicago, and sponsor an associated Computational Social Science workshop. I teach courses in augmented intelligence, the history of modern science, science studies, computational content analysis, and Internet and Society. Before Chicago, I received my doctorate in sociology from Stanford University, served as a research associate in the Negotiation, Organizations, and Markets group at Harvard Business School, started a private high school focused on project-based arts education, and completed a B. A. in Anthropology at Brigham Young University. Homepage Chenhao Tan is an associate professor at the Department of Computer Science and the UChicago Data Science Institute. His main research interests include language and social dynamics, human-centered machine learning , and multi-community engagement. He is also broadly interested in computational social science, natural language processing, and artificial intelligence.

A joint initiative with: To get involved in the AICE research community and receive updates about upcoming events and funding opportunities, please sign up for the AICE email list . Climate change, particularly the exacerbation of extreme events, is among the most pressing challenges facing humanity and the scientific community. Effectively addressing climate change requires rapid advances around 1) improving prediction capabilities and understanding of climate physics, 2) developing quantitative models for climate change’s socioeconomic impacts, and 3) creating new climate adaptation and mitigation strategies. The AI for Climate Initiative (AICE) combines the staggering innovations in AI and rapid increase of data availability with fundamental domain knowledge to significantly advance (1)–(3) in a highly synergistic and interdisciplinary fashion. Close collaboration between different disciplines, e.g., climate science, computer science, economics, math, physics, public health, social science, and statistics, is essential to innovate or properly adapt AI methods for developing novel tools, such as physics-informed predictive models, and trustworthy datasets for training or analysis. From developing foundation AI climate/weather models to large-language models, AICE aims to synergise and support the UChicago, Argonne National Lab, and Toyota Technological Institute communities and external partners to transform climate research. AICE complements, supports, and closely connects existing initiatives, most notably, the DSI’s AI+Science Initiative (led by advisory board member Becca Willett), the Climate and Energy Institute, the Climate Systems Engineering Initiative (CSEi), the Innovation Commission and Development Innovation Lab (led by advisory board member Michael Kremer), and the Trillion Parameter Consortium for AI+Science (Co-led by Co-PI Ian Foster).
